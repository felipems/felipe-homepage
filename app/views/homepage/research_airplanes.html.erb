			Pushing the boundaries of human knowledge is an attitude so core to the human element that we must do it so frequently and so agressively that we can only go to sleep at night knowing there wasn't anything else we could've known that day, for the essence of fresh knowledge is one of life's greatest gifts.

					<h4 "center_content_title">  Motivation</h4>
					25% of the deaths in small aircraft are because the airplane enters a stall/spin. This situation is usually close to the ground and the aerodynamics at play are so complex even expert pilots sometimes fail at recovering the airplane. Robbie's mission, is to build a system that can be attached to these airplanes that automatically activates when the airplane reaches a critical state and recovers it, saving the lives of those on board. 
							
					<h4 "center_content_title">  My Role</h4>
					I work with Robbie on the implementation side of the research topic. Developing this system requires doing extensive flight testing on airplanes ranging from 3-12 foot wingspan.  Mainly, I operate all the radio controlled aircraft needed to carry out the research, including putting and recovering them from different stall/spins and other maneouvers. Protecting thousands of dollars in research with my piloting abilities. Furthermore,  I also provide building and setup support when assembling these complex systems. 


						<h4 "center_content_title">  Goals of flight testing</h4>
							  			
					The overall goals of the flight testing campaign are:
					<ol>
						<li>Demonstrate stall/spins on small scaled aircraft</li>
						<li>Gain experience in the logistics and overall operations of a stall/spin campaign</li>
						<li>Study qualitatively the stall/spin characteristics, this includes:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Flight condition and control actions for spin entry, and its repeatability</li>
							<li>Control sequence and trajectory for early arrest and recovery, and its repeatability</li>
							<li>Control sequence for recovery from developed spin</li>
							<li>Effects of moving CG aft on all of the above
</li>
							<li>Effect of adding more weight and roll, pitch and yaw inertias Aileron roll control effectiveness at different stages of the spin </li>
							<li>Altitude loss at different stages of the spin</li>


						</ul>

						<li>Study quantitatively, by analyzing flight data, the above mentioned stall/ spin characteristics.</li>
						<li>Study qualitatively and quantitatively the stall/spin characteristics from a steady turn</li>
						<li>Study the effect of lowering both ailerons, to emulate a positive twist to the wing, on the stall/spin characteristics</li>
						<li>Develop a control system that can enter a stall/spin automatically, both from straight and level flight and a steady turn</li>
						<li>Hard code a recovery control sequence for early arrest of spin entry, and demonstrate its effectiveness in flight.</li>
					</ol>
