<small><i> You may be asking yourself why I wouldn't simply just write my email down. Turns out there are plenty of bots out there that visit web pages such as this one that try to scavenge email addresses. They later spam these addresses with junk mail or send malicious emails. A picture prevents the bots from  reading the email address as they are normally not equipped with text recognition software.  </i></small>
